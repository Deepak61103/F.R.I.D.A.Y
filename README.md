# FRIDAY - Your AI-Powered Desktop Companion

## Overview

FRIDAY is an advanced voice assistant that uses *OpenAI's API* to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Built using Python, it offers a range of functionalities like voice command recognition, web search, email automation, and system control. Whether you're automating tasks or seeking information, FRIDAY is designed to adapt and execute commands with high precision and speed.

## Features

- *OpenAI-Powered Intelligence*: FRIDAY leverages OpenAI's API to understand and respond with human-like, context-sensitive replies.
- *Voice Command Recognition*: Listens and executes commands given via voice.
- *Email Automation*: Send emails directly using voice commands.
- *System Control*: Open, close, or control system applications and manage tasks like typing, using keyboard shortcuts, and setting reminders.
- *Web Search*: Searches the web based on voice prompts.
- *News Updates*: Opens a browser window to display the latest news.
- *Time Retrieval*: Speaks out the current time in words.
- *Cross-Platform Compatibility*: Built in Python, FRIDAY is optimized to run on both desktop and laptop computers.

- *Task Automation*: Automate typing, web searches, and application control using both voice and keyboard.

## OpenAI Integration

- *Contextual Understanding*: Unlike traditional assistants, FRIDAY interprets user input in real-time, using OpenAI's natural language processing to understand context and deliver meaningful responses beyond just keywords.

- *Continuous Learning*: FRIDAY can improve over time as OpenAI's models evolve, handling increasingly complex commands and refining responses based on user patterns and newer updates.

- *Adaptability Across Tasks*: Whether answering simple inquiries or performing system tasks, FRIDAY adjusts its actions dynamically, driven by OpenAI's flexible models to provide intelligent, accurate assistance.

- *Human-Like Conversations*: FRIDAY mimics human dialogue using OpenAI's language models, making interactions feel more natural, engaging, and less robotic.

- *Multilingual Support*: OpenAI enables FRIDAY to respond in multiple languages, adapting automatically to the user's input and making it versatile for global use.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: The core programming language for FRIDAY, chosen for its simplicity and powerful libraries.
- *OpenAI API*: Enables FRIDAY's AI capabilities for intelligent, context-aware responses.
- *SpeechRecognition*: For converting spoken words into actionable commands.
- *pyttsx3*: Used for text-to-speech conversion.
